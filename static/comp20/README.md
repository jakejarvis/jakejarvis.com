# Personal website of Jake Jarvis

1. I believe I have correctly implemented all three pages. All HTML and CSS pass validation. The only thing I am unsure of is whether or not there are any benefits of making a separate CSS file for each page -- I only used one because splitting them up seemed to me like it would have defeated the purpose of CSS.
2. Collaborated with nobody.
3. Spent approximately 4 hours total.
